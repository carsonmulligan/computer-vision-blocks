a voxel editor using mediapipe hand tracking, threejs, and macbook webcam

This looks like when the hands are not making the finger touching the thumb, then the vision mode is in ready mode. If one finger is touching one thumb, then it is in editing mode and it can pinch to create blocks across this planer space. And then if there are two pinches, so two fingers on two thumbs, then it goes into orbiting mode. Please recreate this with media pipe, hand tracking, and 3JS. If you need Python, then use conda, 3.11.
